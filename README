Pure functions (@pure) may not
- call impure functions
- assign to var's defined outside the function
- read a var defined outside the function
- be overriden by an impure function
- perform IO/change the world


Remarks: <init> is considered a normal function

Pure is the default for methods, every method not marked @impure is considered pure and the constraints are checked, yielding
compiler errors when violated. 

@declarePure can be used to declare impure methods to be pure after all. I.e. if they use impure implementations details but
are referential transparent. 


TODO impure-functions as parameters for pure functions?
