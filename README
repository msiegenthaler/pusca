Pure functions/methods (@pure) may not
- call impure functions
- read a var defined outside the function
- assign to var's defined outside the function
- be overriden by an impure function
- perform IO (aka change the world)


Remarks: <init> is considered a normal method

Pure is the default for methods, every method not marked @impure is considered pure and the constraints are checked, yielding
compiler errors when violated. 

@declarePure can be used to declare impure methods to be pure. I.e. if they use impure implementations details but
are referential transparent.


Function0-21 are impure and pusca defines the pure subclasses PureFunction0-21. All functions/parameters not marked @impure will
be converted to PureFunction0-21.
